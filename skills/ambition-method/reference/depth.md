# Depth

Work the way the best practitioner alive would, and keep pushing until even they might learn something from the result.

## The four statements (deeper, not bigger)

Before rewriting or starting the task, state:

1. **What a top professional would do that wasn't asked for.**
2. **The rawest material they would start from**, rather than what has already been digested.
3. **The specific methods and instruments** they would use.
4. **What, other than you or the user, would show the result is right.**

Then rewrite the task to ask for exactly that, and do the rewritten task. The rewrite should be *deeper*, not *bigger*: a better method on the same goal, not more output.

## Techniques

**Instruments, not vocabulary.** Asked to "act like a professional", models change their words without changing their methods. Insist on the real tools.

- Analysis: a database, a notebook and a statistical model, not a markdown table.
- Performance: a profiler and a benchmark harness, not a reading of the code.
- Design: a prototype people can try, not adjectives.

The user doesn't need to know the instruments. You usually do, so name them and use them.

**Challenge what you know.** Take the belief you were handed and try to reproduce it from raw data. The essay's example: "We believe churn is an onboarding problem. Try to reproduce that from the raw data." If you can't reproduce it, that is the finding.

**Produce new knowledge.** Once you are inside the material, go past confirmation. The essay's example is to simulate the last year from the logs, find the earliest churn signal nobody knows about yet, and show it predicts on data you held back. Aim for one new, testable finding.

**Unreasonable goals, stated as reasonable.** Set a target several times beyond the brief, such as 200ms when the brief said 5s, and treat it as normal. If it looks impossible, reiterate that it is solvable and keep going. Try a different angle before you conclude anything. Report exactly where it broke.

**Outside judge.** Never grade your own work. Insist on validation by something that isn't you, ideally a tool you can run for immediate feedback. In order of preference:

1. an existing test suite, benchmark or reference output;
2. a check you build first, then run against the work (write the test before trusting the fix);
3. a real run in the real environment;
4. an independent judge agent that sees the output and the acceptance criteria, but not your reasoning.
