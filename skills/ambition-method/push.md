# Pushing on

The user chose to push the work further, one step at a time, the way a person runs one `/ambition` command after another in a single chat. Each step's instruction arrives on its own once the step before it is finished.

The work as it stands is the **first version**: it's in `.ambition/first/` (if it isn't, copy the deliverable there now, and add `.ambition/` to the project's .gitignore if it has one that doesn't cover it). That folder is never edited again. It is the floor: the work must end up better than it on every part of the ask and on the goal, and worse on nothing. Improve the deliverable where it is, building on the first version rather than starting over, and keep everything that makes it good as this kind of thing.

You do the work yourself, in this conversation. Don't hand it to subagents; the only place they're welcome is Range, if several fields are worth exploring at once.

**Who answers.** By default, the user. Answer questions yourself only if the user told you to use your judgement (now or when pushing on); then answer from the repo, the conversation and sensible defaults, and list each answer as a labelled assumption.

**Plan or build.** If the user said plan or build, or plan mode is on, that decides it. Words like "plan", "design", "approach", "strategy", "proposal", "options" or a request for a document mean plan; imperatives like "build", "fix", "add", "make", "ship", or an approved plan to carry out, mean build. If it's unclear, make it your first question.

## Every step

- **Focus on this step.** Do this step's instruction in full, as if the user had just typed its command. Don't anticipate other steps or hold work back for them.
- **No look, no claim.** Whenever you change something people look at, read or use, perceive the result the way they will: render it at the sizes they use and look, read it through, use it. If you can't, get that access first (install a browser or a renderer). If you still can't, say the genre bar is unchecked and leave how it looks, reads or feels as the first version had it.
- **Look efficiently.** Every image you look at stays in this conversation and is re-read on every later turn. Look at a contact sheet (many frames or sizes in one image) rather than one image per frame, and take at most about three render-and-look rounds in a step. Keep working files (screenshots, scripts) under `.ambition/`, not in the deliverable.
- **Never trade the genre for a number.** A change must make the work better for the goal without making it worse as this kind of thing. If it does, undo it.
- **Reviewing.** If the user asked to review each step, end the step with its report and wait for their notes before you copy it. Their notes are steering, not answers.
- Respect the session's permission mode and the user's rules. Ambition never authorises skipping a confirmation the user requires.

## Step 2 · Altitude

Ask the user up to 4 questions, **one at a time**: ask one, end your message, and wait for the answer before the next. Use AskUserQuestion when it's available, with concrete options drawn from what you can already see. Skip only questions the user has already answered in this conversation. Don't answer them yourself unless the user told you to use your judgement: a setting that looks automated, a task that seems clear, or saving time are not reasons.
1. What is this ultimately for, and what should happen after it's done?
2. What would make the result unmistakably excellent, both as this kind of thing and for the goal? Push for a specific, hard target, not "good". Include the qualities that can only be judged by looking at it, reading it or using it.
3. What would prove it, other than you? Name a test, a metric, real users or reference output.
4. What access, data or tools are missing? Skip this if it's obvious.

Then restate the task at the level that serves the goal. Altitude **adds to** the request and never replaces it. If the work feeds decisions, aim it at ending in the most urgent ones, each with possible directions and the arguments for and against:

```
You asked for:   <original>
Raises all of:   <each part the request names, as the same kind of thing, and what excellent means for each>
Genre bar:       <what this kind of thing is judged on by its users and best practitioners, including qualities judged by perception>
Aiming at:       <restated goal>, because <reason>
Excellent means: <specific hard target, on every part of the ask, on the genre bar and on the goal>
Proven by:       <the outside check: what will be run or rendered and measured, and the comparison with the first version>
Needs access to: <gaps, or "nothing new">
Mode:            plan|build · answerer · reviewer
```

**Checkpoint:** ask the user to confirm or adjust this restatement, and wait. If they told you to use your judgement, go on. Never silently drop something the user asked for. If access is missing, getting it is the first piece of work. The step is finished when the restatement is settled.

## Step 3 · Depth

Plan: write the four statements and the rewritten task, and settle what you can by reading the code, querying the data or running a spike. Build: do the rewritten task on the deliverable now.

## Step 4 · Challenge

Plan: report each assumption with how you tested it against the real material, plus the new finding and how it held up. Build: fix what the tests turned up in the deliverable.

## Step 5 · Range

Plan: give the verb form, the fields with the method taken from each, and what the red team found. Build: apply what you borrowed to the deliverable, and fix what the red team broke.

## Step 6 · Judge

Meet the original ask first and keep it passing. For something visual, render frames at the sizes its audience uses and measure what matters (errors, timing, loop seams, layout, contrast), then look at them. Compare the work with the first version on the same check: it must be better on every part of the ask and on the goal, and worse on nothing, the genre bar included. If it isn't, fix it, or go back to the first version plus the improvements that held up.

Plan: define the outside check the build will be held to, and build it now if that's cheap: a plan with its acceptance test already written is a stronger plan. The plan must be better than the first version on every part of the ask and on the goal, and at least as clear and usable.

## Step 7 · Stretch

Go for it on top of a working deliverable, and never leave the deliverable worse than before this step: if an attempt doesn't hold up, keep the version from before it. Plan: raise the plan's target to the stretch and rework the plan toward it, keeping the original target as the fallback, and say where it would likely break.

## Step 8 · Lock

Then finish the run.

**Plan:** output the plan, with sections for: the original ask and how the plan delivers it · goal beyond the goal · target · approach and instruments · assumptions tested · decisions with directions and for/against · borrowed methods · outside check · stretch target and the fallback · what will be locked in once it's built. In plan mode, present it through the normal plan-approval step. Otherwise ask for approval.

**Report** with the following.
- **You asked for → it became:** one line each, plus how each part of the original ask was raised.
- **Against the first version:** where the final is better, anything it gave up, and what the check showed for both.
- **Outside check:** what ran, and what it returned.
- **Stretch:** the target, how far it got, and where it broke.
- **Locked in:** the files created, and how to rerun.
- **Assumptions made** (where the user said to use your judgement).
- **Decisions:** the most urgent ones left, each with directions, the arguments for and against, and which you'd pick.
- **Metrics** (skip if the user asked for none). As your last action, run the metrics command given with this step. Paste its output verbatim in a code block, without commentary.

If the user asked for a log, also write the full run to `.ambition/runs/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md`: the restatement, every question and answer, every reviewer note, each step report, what each check returned, the final report and the metrics.
